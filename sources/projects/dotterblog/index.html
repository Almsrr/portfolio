              AMD now offers Ryzen 5000 processors with integrated GPUs, but you
              can’t buy them yet
            </h3>
            <p class="author">Chaim Gartenberg</p>
            <p class="date">Apr 13, 2021</p>
            <p>
              AMD has announced a new version of its Ryzen 5000 desktop
              processors — the Ryzen 5000 G-Series, which (like AMD’s previous
              G-Series offerings) adds an integrated GPU to the company’s
              existing Ryzen processors.
            </p>
            <p>
              The company is launching six new APUs today. There are three 65W
              chips for more powerful machines — an eight-core Ryzen 7 5700G
              model, a six-core Ryzen 5 5600G, and a quad-core Ryzen 3 5300G —
              along with a trio of 35W GE chips with slightly less power and
              thermal headroom. And like their GPU-less counterparts, the new
              chips use AMD’s 7nm process and feature its Zen 3 architecture.

              Pinterest will now let workers blow the whistle on harassment and
              discrimination, despite NDAs
            </h3>
            <p class="author">Sean Hollister</p>
            <p class="date">Apr 13, 2021</p>
            <p>
              Pinterest has been battered with accusations of workplace
              discrimination for many months, and we’ve followed a large portion
              of that saga here at The Verge. That includes, most recently, how
              Ifeoma Ozoma, a former Pinterest employee who accused the company
              of trying to silence her, helped draft California’s new Silenced
              No More Act. Today, Ozoma is speaking out in The New York Times
              about why she believes nondisclosure agreements (NDAs) should not
              be allowed to keep whistleblowers in check — but Pinterest now
              says, effective immediately, it will stop making workers sign NDAs
              that prevent them from talking about such things.

              Sony invests another $200 million in Epic Games
            </h3>
            <p class="author">Jon Porter</p>
            <p class="date">Apr 13, 2021</p>
            <p>
              Sony has just invested another $200 million in Epic Games as part
              of a $1 billion funding round, Epic announced today. Over a dozen
              investors contributed toward the funding round, which valued the
              Fortnite developer at $28.7 billion. That’s over $10 billion more
              than Epic Games’ estimated value at the time of Sony’s major
              investment last July.
            </p>
            <p>
              Epic Games CEO Tim Sweeney is still the company’s controlling
              shareholder after the investment. In a press release, Sweeney said
              that Epic will use the investment to “help accelerate our work
              around building connected social experiences in Fortnite, Rocket
              League and Fall Guys, while empowering game developers and
              creators with Unreal Engine, Epic Online Services and the Epic
              Games Store.”

              Discord will block NSFW servers on iOS
            </h3>
            <p class="author">Jacob Kastrenakes</p>
            <p class="date">Apr 13, 2021</p>
            <p>
              Discord is amping up its restrictions on adult content, with new
              age gates on NSFW servers and a ban on accessing these servers
              from iOS devices.
            </p>
            <p>
              Entire servers can now be marked as NSFW if their community “is
              organized around NSFW themes or if the majority of the server’s
              content is 18+.” This label will be a requirement going forward,
              and Discord will proactively mark servers as NSFW if they fail to
              self-identify. Discord previously allowed individual channels to
              be marked as NSFW and age-gated.
            </p>
            <p>
              The NSFW marker does two things. First, it prevents anyone under
              the age of 18 from joining. But the bigger limitation is that it
              prevents NSFW servers from being accessed on iOS devices — a
              significant restriction that’s almost certainly meant to cater to
              Apple’s strict and often prudish rules around nudity in services
              distributed through the App Store. Tumblr infamously wiped porn
              from its entire platform in order to come into compliance with
              Apple’s rules.
